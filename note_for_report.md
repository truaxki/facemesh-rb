# Rolling Baseline Feature Generation for Temporal Facemesh Analysis

## Abstract

This section documents the development and implementation of rolling baseline feature generation methodology for enhancing temporal analysis capabilities in facemesh tracking data. The approach addresses the need for contextual temporal features by computing moving averages and deviations across multiple time scales, enabling more sophisticated analysis of facial movement patterns and stability metrics.

## Background and Motivation

### Problem Statement

Traditional facemesh analysis relies primarily on instantaneous coordinate positions and frame-to-frame differences. While these features provide spatial information, they lack temporal context necessary for:

1. **Movement Stability Assessment**: Distinguishing between intentional movements and involuntary tremors
2. **Baseline Deviation Detection**: Identifying sudden changes relative to recent behavioral patterns  
3. **Temporal Pattern Recognition**: Capturing movement dynamics across different time scales
4. **Noise Reduction**: Smoothing measurement artifacts through temporal averaging

### Research Objectives

The primary objective was to develop an automated pipeline for generating rolling baseline features that:
- Preserve original data integrity while adding temporal context
- Support multiple temporal scales for multi-resolution analysis
- Enable efficient processing of large-scale facemesh datasets
- Provide interpretable features for downstream analysis

## Methodology

### Rolling Baseline Algorithm

The rolling baseline approach computes temporal features using a sliding window methodology:

**For each coordinate feature `feat_i_axis` and window size `n`:**

1. **Rolling Average**: `RB_n(t) = (1/n) × Σ[feat_i_axis(t-n+1) to feat_i_axis(t)]`
2. **Baseline Deviation**: `RBD_n(t) = feat_i_axis(t) - RB_n(t)`

Where:
- `t` represents the current time point (frame)
- `n` is the rolling window size (5 or 10 frames)
- `RB_n(t)` captures the recent average position
- `RBD_n(t)` measures instantaneous deviation from recent baseline

### Implementation Specifications

**Technical Parameters:**
- **Window Sizes**: 5 frames (short-term) and 10 frames (long-term)
- **Minimum Periods**: 1 (handles sequence start gracefully)
- **Alignment**: Right-aligned (includes current frame)
- **Processing**: Vectorized operations using pandas rolling functions

**Feature Generation:**
- **Input**: 1,434 base coordinate features (478 landmarks × 3 axes)
- **Output per window**: 2,868 features (1,434 rolling averages + 1,434 deviations)
- **Total new features**: 5,736 features per file (2 windows × 2,868 features)

### Data Processing Pipeline

The implementation consisted of three main components:

1. **Data Validation and Preprocessing**
   - Verification of feature column integrity
   - Exclusion of previously derived features
   - Empty file detection and handling

2. **Optimized Feature Computation**
   - Batch column creation to prevent DataFrame fragmentation
   - Memory-efficient processing using pandas vectorization
   - Progress tracking for large dataset processing

3. **Output Generation**
   - Separate files per temporal scale (*-rb5.csv, *-rb10.csv)
   - Preservation of original metadata columns
   - Comprehensive processing statistics and validation

## Results

### Processing Statistics

**Dataset Characteristics:**
- **Total Files Processed**: 150 facemesh recordings
- **Empty Files Identified**: 7 (automatically skipped)
- **Processing Success Rate**: 100% (0 failures)

```python
# Key optimization: Batch column creation
new_columns = {}
for feat_col in feature_cols:
    rolling_mean = df[feat_col].rolling(window=window, min_periods=1).mean()
    new_columns[f"{feat_col}_rb{window}"] = rolling_mean
    new_columns[f"{feat_col}_rb{window}_diff"] = df[feat_col] - rolling_mean

# Single concatenation operation
df_output = pd.concat([df, pd.DataFrame(new_columns)], axis=1)
```
